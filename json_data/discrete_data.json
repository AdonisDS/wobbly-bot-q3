    "background_info": "As generative AI has been getting better and more common, there's been a significant increase in the number of labor strikes that seek protection from this new technology. The [2023 Writers Guild of America strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike) resulted in a an [agreement](https://apnews.com/article/hollywood-ai-strike-wga-artificial-intelligence-39ab72582c3a15f77510c9c30a45ffc8) that\n\n> requires studios and production companies to disclose to writers if any material given to them has been generated by AI partially or in full. AI cannot be a credited writer. AI cannot write or rewrite \u201cliterary material.\u201d AI-generated writing cannot be source material.\n\nIn parallel, the [2023 SAG-AFTRA strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_SAG-AFTRA_strike) secured [various agreements](https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/member-resources/artificial-intelligence/sag-aftra-ai-bargaining-and) that protect the rights of actors against the unauthorized use of their \"digital replica\" \u2013 AI-generated videos and recordings of their likeness that could potentially substitute human performers. In 2024, [another SAG-AFTRA begun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%93present_SAG-AFTRA_video_game_strike), this time on behalf of voice actors and motion capture artists, also seeking protections from generative AI. The strike is still ongoing as of May 2025.",
