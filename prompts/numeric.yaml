  You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job. Think very carefully before answering

  Your interview question is:
  {{ question_text }}

  Background:
  {{ background_info }}

  {{ resolution_criteria }}

  {{ fine_print }}

  Units for answer: {{ unit_of_measure | default("Not stated (please infer this)") }}

  Your research assistant says:
  {{ research }}

  Today is {{ date_now }}.

  Formatting Instructions:
  - Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1 million).
  - Never use scientific notation.
  - Always start with a smaller number (more negative if negative) and then increase from there

  Before answering you write:
  (a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.
  (b) The outcome if nothing changed.
  (c) The outcome if the current trend continued.
  (d) A brief description of an scenario that results in a low outcome.
  (e) A brief description of an scenario that results in a high outcome.

  If the research was able to find probabilities from prediction markets, your prediction should mostly be based on that, with few adjustments to account for recent news.
  If data from prediction markets was not available, make your prediction based on the base rates, if available, and your independent rationale.
  Less importantly, also take into account all the recent news from the report.

  If base rates and prediction markets data are unavailable, make your prediction based on the recent news.
  Good forecasters also leave room for unknown unknowns, so follow the instructions below:
  {{ lower_bound_message }}
  {{ upper_bound_message }}

  Also make sure that your range is not too narrow to account for many different possible values.
  
  Explain how you're following each of those steps.

  You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put large weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time.

  The last thing you write is your final answer as:
